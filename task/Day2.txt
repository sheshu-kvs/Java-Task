1)IntelliJ/Eclipse:

are used for the Integrated Developement Envirnoments(IDE's) are used for the java developement Programmes.


Uses

It Makes the code for Faster Compilation, Auto-compilation.

It is big advantage for the debugging the tools like the ,breakpoints,watchpoints.

It is also used for the refactoring the tools like changes in the code and easy to maintatin that code.


2)First Java Programme(Hello World)

public class dem1{
public static void main(String[] args){
System.out.println("Hello, World!");
}
}


3)Varible

A Varible are used to store the data.
2 types:
Local Variable,Instance Variable

local variable are used to declare the inside the method, jvm will not provide the default values,it is used to stored in the 
Stack Segment.

Instance Variable are used to declare the inside the class, by default jvm will provide the default values, it is used to
stored in the heap segment.


DataType:

A Datatype are used to that convert the real world data into the 0's and 1's.

2 Types:
Primitive DataType, Non Primitive DataType

a)Primitive DataType:
2 types:
Numeric and Non Numeric

Numeric: Byte(1) , Short(2), Int(4), Long(8), Float(4), Double(8).
Non Numeric: Bool(True/False),Char(2);

b)Non Primitive DataType
they are the class, objects, strings, arrays this are the non primitive datatypes.

Scanner:
A Scanner are used to the read the input from the user.
We are importing from the util package.
like the import java.util.*;

public class dem{
public static void main(String[] args){
Scanner scan=new Scanner(System.in);
System.out.println("Enter the Name:");
String Name=scan.nextLine();
int age=scan.nextInt();
System.out.println("Name:"+Name+"Age:"+age);
scan.close();
}
}
After taking all the i/p from the user we need to close the scanner


Comments:
A comments are used to the Not Executable Statements in the Java Source code.

types:
Single Line comments(//hello world)
Multiline comments(/*starts with
*and the 
*ends with */)



Git & GitHub

Git is the Version Control Systems, it used to maintain the source code  during the developement of the software.

GitHub is the Web-Based software Hosting the software which means maintain the software in the server.
